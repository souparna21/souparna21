👨‍🎓 Hey! I'm Sabyasachi (you can call me Sabya😛), a 23 year old software engineer at **TCS** based in Hyderabad, India.

I was hired as a **Systems Engineer** in **TCS Digital** and have been working as a **Big Data Engineer** for one of its developement projects at **LLoyds Banking Group(UK)**. I have been using **SparkSQL, Scala** and **Hive** as my tech stack in every day work under an **Agile** based wokflow.

👩‍💻 Nowadays, I’m learning React and Spring Boot as I aspire to be a fullstack developer. I regularly practice DSA questions on [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/user8392Cc/), [**CodeChef**](https://www.codechef.com/users/sabyasachi2301) and [**HackerRank.**](https://www.hackerrank.com/sabyasachi_das)

⚡ Fun fact: I have a Electronics and Communication Engineering background with an ardent interest in IOT, but gradually shifted towards the world of Computer Science Engineering. I like to call myself a self taught programmer but I owe all my knowledge to Google, Youtube, Udemy and various tech blogs.

📚 I am also an avid reader with a keen interest in mythological stories.
